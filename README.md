# SparkBLEWindows
Sample writing to Spark amp with BLE in Windows   

Javascript in a Chrome browser console window - cool, never knew you could do that   

Bleak BLE client in Python   ```pip install bleak```   
Bless BLE server in Python   ```pip install bless```

bleakx.py = clients to connect to the amp     
blessx.py = server to spoof the amp (creates a server but doesn't fool the app yet!)    
blex.py = clieant and server in one file, with aim to connect to amp and spoof amp in one program.
